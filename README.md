# Last but not least
#### *Have fun ⭐* I know this way this pretty hard. I’ll tell you the secret to fighting strong enemies. It’s easy, keep getting up and attack them with your moves continuously.
#### I knew someone who came to this repo copy. Yes, you can but Victory is never decided by programing performance alone. Nor by the skill of the programmer, alone. The result itself is the only truth!
